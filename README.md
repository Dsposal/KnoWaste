## Waste Management Scenarios

Waste management is the process of storing waste, transforming waste into a non-waste state (for example: recycling) or disposing of waste (for example: sending waste to landfill). 

When waste is managed, it can be:

* **Aggregated**: Waste in different containers with the same classificaion are added together
* **Co-mingled**: Waste in different containers with difference classifications are added together
* **Disposed**: Waste in a container is sent to a final destination, for example, landfill.
* **Separated**: Waste in a container is sorted and split, for example, a waste skip  of metal, rubble, soil and stones separated into skips of metal, rubble, soil and stones
* **Transformed**: Waste in a container is changed into non-waste, for example, glass from a bar is crushed into [glass cullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_recycling)
