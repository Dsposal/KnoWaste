**The Future of Waste is Smart**

*#SmartWaste = Tracking + Accountability*

The UK as a whole is moving towards sustainability by reducing, re-using and recycling. Each nation seeks to preserve resources, minimise waste, send less to landfill, protect our ecology and make a positive impact on climate change. The future of waste is smart waste, efficiently tracking waste to it’s final destination and accountability for waste throughout it’s lifecycle.

**The Future of Waste Accountability**

*Knowing “Where did my business waste go?”*

What do we mean by accountability? That everyone handling waste knows with a high-degree of certainty their responsibilities for handling waste and where their waste ended up


**The Future of Waste Tracking**

*Knowing “Where is my business waste now?”*

Efficiently tracking waste is the way to ensure everyone knows where the waste they handled is right now and can follow the journey of waste containers to their final destination.

**#SmartWaste means smart use of data**

*Stitching together the waste data patchwork*

Smart waste means smart use of data to stitch together the patchwork of today’s waste data including returns from permitted sites, voluntary initiatives and one-off surveys. We know from HM Government’s [Resources and Waste Strategy for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england) that waste data is time-consuming, complex to use and doesn’t support effective tacking of waste crime. We know today’s technologies can help make better use of waste data to become a zero waste society.


**Open Standards Make Waste Smarter**

*Fast, easily combined data for tracking & accountability*

Among the many technologies that support smarter waste, [open standards for data](http://standards.theodi.org/) make an excellent starting point. Good quality, timely, easy to access data is essential to support fast, easily combined data for tracking and accountability in waste.

## The KnoWaste Data Standard <a name="knowaste_data_standard"></a>

Our solution, in collaboration with [Dsposal](https://dsposal.uk/), [University of Bradford](https://www.bradford.ac.uk) and [Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) is the **KnoWaste Data Standard**. The standard has 3 parts:

* A #SmartWaste standard to handle tracking and auditing of waste holders waste jobs, waste containers
* An electronic **Duty of Care Document** for consistent completion of non-hazardous waste documentation
* An electronic **Consignment Note** to support consistent completion of hazardous waste documentation

## How Waste is Managed <a name="how_waste_is_managed"></a>

Waste management is the process of storing waste, transforming waste into a non-waste state (for example: recycling) or disposing of waste (for example: sending waste to landfill). 

When waste is managed, it can be:

* **Aggregated**: Waste in different containers with the same classificaion are added together
* **Co-mingled**: Waste in different containers with difference classifications are added together
* **Disposed**: Waste in a container is sent to a final destination, for example, landfill.
* **Separated**: Waste in a container is sorted and split, for example, a waste skip  of metal, rubble, soil and stones separated into skips of metal, rubble, soil and stones
* **Transformed**: Waste in a container is changed into non-waste, for example, glass from a bar is crushed into [glass cullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_recycling)
