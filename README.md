**The Future of Waste is Smart**

*#SmartWaste = Tracking + Accountability*

The UK as a whole is moving towards sustainability by reducing, re-using and recycling. Each nation seeks to preserve resources, minimise waste, send less to landfill, protect our ecology and make a positive impact on climate change. The future of waste is smart waste, efficiently tracking waste to it’s final destination and accountability for waste throughout it’s lifecycle.

**The Future of Waste Accountability**

*Knowing “Where did my business waste go?”*

What do we mean by accountability? That everyone handling waste knows with a high-degree of certainty their responsibilities for handling waste and where their waste ended up


**The Future of Waste Tracking**

*Knowing “Where is my business waste now?”*

Efficiently tracking waste is the way to ensure everyone knows where the waste they handled is right now and can follow the journey of waste containers to their final destination.

**#SmartWaste means smart use of data**

*Stitching together the waste data patchwork*

Smart waste means smart use of data to stitch together the patchwork of today’s waste data including returns from permitted sites, voluntary initiatives and one-off surveys. We know from HM Government’s [Resources and Waste Strategy for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england) that waste data is time-consuming, complex to use and doesn’t support effective tacking of waste crime. We know today’s technologies can help make better use of waste data to become a zero waste society.


**Open Standards Make Waste Smarter**

*Fast, easily combined data for tracking & accountability*

Among the many technologies that support smarter waste, [open standards for data](http://standards.theodi.org/) make an excellent starting point. Good quality, timely, easy to access data is essential to support fast, easily combined data for tracking and accountability in waste.

Our solution, in collaboration with [Dsposal](https://dsposal.uk/), [University of Bradford](https://www.bradford.ac.uk) and [Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) is the **KnoWaste Data Standard**. 

The standard has 3 parts:

* A #SmartWaste standard to handle tracking and auditing of waste holders waste jobs, waste containers
* An electronic **Duty of Care Document** for consistent completion of non-hazardous waste documentation
* An electronic **Consignment Note** to support consistent completion of hazardous waste documentation

**Unique Identifiers**

*The secret to making #SmartWaste possible*

Identifiers are the most important part of the KnoWaste data standard. These little codes allow us to pinpoint and follow a waste container and a waste job till it reaches a final destination. We can tell when new documentation was raised, when the contents of a waste container was stored, changed or entered landfill. With this data in place, we can take advantage of other technologies to keep track of waste and make auditing easier and faster.

**Who & What to Track & Audit**

In UK waste management, waste is produced by a **Waste Producer** who stores and classifies waste before handing it over to a **Waste Processor**. The **Waste Processor** managea waste till it reaches a final site (for example: landfill) or a final state (for example: recycled). Waste comes in **Waste Containers** and a **Waste Job** could be for several **Waste Containers**. If waste is not hazardous, the main document for a ‘Waste Transfer’ is the **Duty of Care Document** and the **Consignment Note** is needed for hazardous waste. KnoWaste tracks the organisations and documents shown here.

## How Waste is Managed <a name="how_waste_is_managed"></a>

Waste management is the process of storing waste, transforming waste into a non-waste state (for example: recycling) or disposing of waste (for example: sending waste to landfill). 

When waste is managed, it can be:

* **Aggregated**: Waste in different containers with the same classificaion are added together
* **Co-mingled**: Waste in different containers with difference classifications are added together
* **Disposed**: Waste in a container is sent to a final destination, for example, landfill.
* **Separated**: Waste in a container is sorted and split, for example, a waste skip  of metal, rubble, soil and stones separated into skips of metal, rubble, soil and stones
* **Transformed**: Waste in a container is changed into non-waste, for example, glass from a bar is crushed into [glass cullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_recycling)
