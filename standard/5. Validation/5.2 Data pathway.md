5.2 Data pathway
=
Similar to the paper pathway tests, the standard has been informally tested against a variety of datasets - public registers and the anonymised hazardous waste transfer data.

Because the standard was developed using the data, they remain closely aligned. Certain needs have been addressed, however, that mean the standard diverges from current data, though statutory reporting requirements continue to be met. 

Again, this will be more formally tested as part of Phase 2 of the project.
