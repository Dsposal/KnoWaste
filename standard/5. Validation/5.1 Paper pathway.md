The standard was designed based on information gathered from the outputs from Defraâ€™s discovery exercise, workshops, and paperwork templates.

The specification of the standard was then informally tested against examples of waste management paperwork that were provided by Alderley Park, Emerge, and others.

Formal testing of the standard against paper pathways will be planned as part of Phase 2 of the project, as the prototype moves towards an Alpha standard.
