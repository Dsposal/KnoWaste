While testing against paperwork, we found some instances where paperwork was incomplete e.g. sacks selected but number of sacks not provided. Identifying legal entities requires some consideration, especially where the organisation has multiple identities (company numbers) at the same address. Signatures, vehicle registration, support for multiple collections and multiple permits, exceptions or licences did not work as expected and should be reviewed.
