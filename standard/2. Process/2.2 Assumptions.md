2.2 Assumptions
=======
Because this is a prototype standard, there are certain assumptions that we have made during development, in order to make the best use of the time available. 

These assumptions can be rigorously stress-tested in phase 2 of the project, should KnoWaste be successful in advancing.

We have assumed that the facilities management approach to waste management is representative of the wider waste management system.

We have assumed that the pathways relating to solvents and paper are representative of the wider waste management system.

We have assumed that current data items, paperwork and data reporting mechanisms will persist.

We have assumed that current policy and legislation will remain unchanged.

We have assumed that participants in the workshops were acting with integrity.
