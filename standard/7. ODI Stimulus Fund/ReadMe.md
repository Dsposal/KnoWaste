7 ODI Stimulus Fund - prototype open standard for Household Waste Recycling Centres
=======

The files within this section are a **work in progress**.

[Your Dsposal](https://dsposal.uk/articles/introducing-your-dsposal/) won funding from the Open Data Institute to look into all the recycling centres within the UK and to look at standardising the information that is presented to the public. You can read more about it from the [ODI’s blog](https://theodi.org/project/rd-data-access-stimulus-fund/).

This is an open project. That means we are working openly and the results will be published openly. We know there has been work done in this area before, and we’re sure there’s probably work going on right now. We don’t want to reinvent the wheel. We do want to collaborate with as many people as possible. We want to hear from you, regardless of your expertise, experience or position. You do not need to be a data expert. If you care about or are interested in household waste recycling centres and how providing information about those to the public could be improved then please get involved.

There’s a bunch of different ways you could take part:
- Workshops (almost certainly virtual)
- Interviews (again, virtual)
- Data Entry (if that is your thing! It’s my fave!)
- Idea Generation

But being an open project means we should be talking to as many people as possible to understand what could be useful to everybody when this research is released into the open, and when the data we identified, compiled and cleaned is released into the open. So whether you work at a local authority, run a disposal authority, look after an HWRC, do comms and marketing, are a regulator, compliance scheme, consultant, software developer, or anything else we’d love you to get involved.

In case you are wondering what open data is:

> Open data is data that should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.

If you want to know more then get involved by:
- intereacting with Github

Thank you in advance for your help,

Kindest Regards,

Tom Passmore
