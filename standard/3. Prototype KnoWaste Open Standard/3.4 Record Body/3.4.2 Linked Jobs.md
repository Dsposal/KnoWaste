3.4.2 Linked Jobs
=
Once a waste job arrives at the waste site, the KnoWaste tracking is complete. However, waste jobs have a life beyond arrival at the destination. KnoWaste has been designed to track jobs through these scenarios:

**Aggregation or multi-drop**: Multiple jobs (JobA1, JobA2, JobA3) are aggregated into a single new job (JobA4). In this scenario, a non-hazardous job can become dangerous or hazardous due to change in quantities or concentrations of waste. Contamination may be found and illegal co-mingling could occur. To handle this scenario, in the new job, KnoWaste tracks the incoming, globally unique job numbers that were aggregated to create this job.
