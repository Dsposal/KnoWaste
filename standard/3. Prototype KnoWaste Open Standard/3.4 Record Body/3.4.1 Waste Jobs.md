3.4.1 Waste Jobs
=
In KnoWaste, a waste job is the process of collecting waste from a waste holder (a waste producer or waste site) and transporting the waste to another location for processing. 

A waste job starts with the waste producer and tracks a single instance of waste being transported and processed. Where a waste carrier collects waste from many waste producers or a waste producer has a contract for many waste collections, a waste job refers to each individual collection from each individual waste producer.
