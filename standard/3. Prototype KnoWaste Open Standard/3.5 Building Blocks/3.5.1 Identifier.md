3.5.1 Identifier
=
Identifiers help us track waste by pinpointing the individual organisations, waste containers, paperwork, and locations involved in a waste job. Where possible, KnoWaste provides the option to use a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) alongside codes for identifiers. 

|Field Name|Data Type|Required|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|uri|uri|Optional (if scheme is provided)|Uri to identify the data source. Use this field when the id is part of an online register. This is the preferred way to link to a register that supports uri. For example: this uri (https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/) links to the Gov.UK register for Local authorities in England.|
|scheme|string|Optional (if uri is provided)|The scheme using codes from http://org-id.guide/ which is based on the codes previously maintained by International Aid Transparency Initiative or KnoWaste lists. This the alternative way to link to a register that doesnâ€™t support a uri. For example: the Local Authorities for England Register uses the code: GB-LAE|
|code|string|Always|Unique code to identify a person, organisation, place or thing. For example: SHE is the code for Folkestone and Hythe Council in the Local Authorities for England Register|
|id|string|Always|Globally unique identifier for a person, organisation, place or thing. For example: https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk/records/SHE is the uri identifier for Folkestone and Hythe Council in the Local Authorities for England Register. Use this method when a uri is available. GB-LAE-SHE is the alternative identifier for Folkestone and Hythe Council in the Local Authorities for England Register. It combines the scheme GB-LAE with the code SHE. Use this method when a uri is not available.|
|name|string|Always|Name of the person, organisation, place or thing.|
