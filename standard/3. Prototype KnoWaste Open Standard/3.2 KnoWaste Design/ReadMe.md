3.2 KnoWaste Design
=======
KnoWaste uses a modular structure of sections to represent an activity, event, person, organisation, place or thing.

***Sections*** contain fields and child sections - some child sections may contain many records for a single parent section. 

***Building blocks*** contain repeated and common features, for example, organisations, dates or identifiers.	

***Code lists*** categorise and classify an activity, event, person, organisation, place or thing. External lists are maintained by recognised authorities, for example, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. Internal code lists are also created and maintained by KnoWaste to support better use of the standard, for example, roles.
