|Legal Entity|A legal entity is the person and organisation involved in waste who has a legal responsibility. For person, we mean a sole trader and unregistered group acting as a legal entity or organisation, rather than people within organisations.|
|Address|Addresses help us locate legal entities and track waste including where waste is stored, moved to, being processed, or sent to when rejected. Addresses following the PostalAddress schema from schema.org so the standard works with UK and international addresses as well as other data standards. Identifiers from commercial products such as UPRN or UDPRN are optional.|
