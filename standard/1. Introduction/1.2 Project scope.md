1.2 Project scope
=======
The scope of this project was to produce a prototype open data standard for waste pathways in England. Development of the prototype focussed on commercial waste being dealt with by facilities management companies. Both hazardous and non-hazardous waste pathways were used to develop the standard.

Beyond the scope of this phase of the project were waste pathways in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and also waste pathways involving international transfers of waste. Although these are out of scope for developing the prototype, we consider them in this report, particularly in relation to future phases of the project.
