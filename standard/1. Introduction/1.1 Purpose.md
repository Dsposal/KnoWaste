1.1 Purpose
=======

Without an accepted standard for management of information in this ecosystem, it would be tremendously difficult to develop a solution that meets the needs of all stakeholders. The development and implementation of a standard also provides greater opportunities for other organisations to enter the marketplace, thereby increasing competition, which ultimately leads to better products and services.

The standard will also facilitate better use of data to understand and evidence the impact of better waste management. Defra is known as a vanguard for open data, and the development of an open standard in this space, and the associated release of open data will further that reputation.

In this document we present a proposed framework for describing the waste management pathway through development of a prototype open data standard. We explain our approach to developing the prototype, the detail of the prototype, the lessons weâ€™ve learned while developing the prototype, and our proposal for progressing the standard from a prototype to an alpha.
