KnoWaste Prototype open standard for waste management pathway
========

In this repository we present a proposed framework for describing the waste management pathway through development of a prototype open data standard. We explain our approach to developing the prototype, the detail of the prototype, the lessons weâ€™ve learned while developing the prototype, and our proposal for progressing the standard from a prototype to an alpha.

The standard was developed as part of the first phase of GovTech Challenge for Defra.
