KnoWaste prototype open standard for waste management pathway
========

In this repository we present a proposed framework for describing the waste management pathway through development of a prototype open data standard. We explain our approach to developing the prototype, the detail of the prototype, the lessons we’ve learned while developing the prototype, and our proposal for progressing the standard from a prototype to an alpha.

Open Data Manchester developed the prototype standard as part of the [KnoWaste](https://dsposal.uk/articles/knowaste-govtech-catalyst/) project led by [Dsposal](https://dsposal.uk/about-us) in partnership with the [University of Bradford](https://www.brad.ac.uk/management/). It was selected for Phase I of the [GovTech Catalyst Challenge for Defra](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-govtech-catalyst-challenge-process)

Although the data standard is being developed as part of the KnoWaste project it is independant of it and we see its potential to help improve the tracking of our waste, increase recycling rates and reduce waste crime that costs the UK over [£600 million per year](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-steps-up-the-fight-against-waste-criminals). The inability to track waste is not only a UK problem, its impacts on health and the environment are felt around the world on the land and in our oceans.
