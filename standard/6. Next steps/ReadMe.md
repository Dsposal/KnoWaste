Phase I allowed the development of a prototype data standard as outlined in in this deliverable. This standard came from the analysis of the paperwork, statutory requirements and workshops with data producers, processors and facilities management. The prototype standard allowed us to see if the concept of creating a unified open standard for the waste management pathway on which products and services could be built was feasible.

Phase II will allow us to build on this work and develop a version 1.0 of the standard. This work would involve setting up of an industry advisory group who would have oversight and governance of the development of the standard and act as standard custodians.

The phase will allow further work in identifying material classification strategies – such as the National Materials Datahub that will allow a more granular classification of waste.

Technically the standard would be implemented through a process of establishing data structures and defining the architecture, identifying schema languages, data patterns, validation and quality evaluation approaches. Data structures would be translated into a schema language with appropriate fields and relationships being defined. Technical documentation would be created and validation tools developed.

To aid adoption effort would be undertaken to develop a community around the use of the standard which would act as adoption advocates and peer-to-peer implementation support. To aid implementation further technical ‘helpdesk’ support would be developed.
